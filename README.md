This project explores the possibility of using NLP algorithms to identify scam messages.

Scam detection in emails has become an increasingly urgent challenge in the digital age. With the rise of online communication, email remains one of the most common vectors for fraudulent activity. We aim to train NLP algorithms to be able to recognise and flag out such scams.


A brief overview of our project:
1. Enron Fraud Email Dataset wil be used to train the word embedding layer of our pipeline

2. We will be comparing two different model pipelines, their efficiency and accuracy will be evaluated
3. Finally, we will conduct some ablation studies on our best perfoming model
